## Project Description: The e-Building

The project consists of building a new production facility starting in 2024 with a **total initial investment of €197 million**, allocated to:

* Land
* Industrial building
* Plant, machinery, and equipment

Key features of the project include:

* Progressive increase in production volumes (from 600 to 4,800 units)
* Sales ramp-up from 500 to 4,500 units
* Unit selling price of €200,000
* Fixed production and marketing costs
* Corporate tax rate of 24%

The project is financed through a **mixed capital structure**, with a baseline debt-to-equity ratio of 1.66 and a cost of debt of 5%.

---

## Financial Methodology

The evaluation is conducted using multiple corporate finance tools:

### Profitability and Value Metrics

* Return on Equity (ROE)
* Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
* Economic Value Added (EVA)
* Market Value Added (MVA)

### Capital Budgeting

* Net Present Value (NPV)
* Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

### Risk and Sensitivity Analysis

* Break-even analysis on sales volumes
* Scenario analysis with alternative capital structures (D/E = 0 and D/E = 2)

---

## Results

The baseline analysis shows:

* Negative profitability and EVA in early years due to high upfront investment
* Strong improvement over time as production scales up
* Positive EVA and substantial MVA in later periods
* Positive and robust NPV and IRR

Overall, the project **creates value and exceeds its cost of capital**, indicating that it is financially sustainable in the long run.

---

## Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis

* A reduction of approximately **40% in average sales volumes** drives NPV close to zero, identifying the project’s demand risk threshold.
* With **D/E = 0**, value creation remains positive but weaker, highlighting the role of leverage.
* With **D/E = 2**, ROE, EVA, and MVA increase significantly, showing strong leverage effects but also higher financial risk.

## Investment Perspective

From an investor’s point of view, the project contributes positively to Ferrari’s valuation. A binomial tree analysis of Ferrari’s stock price (RACE) shows that actual market outcomes exceeded earlier forecasts, partly due to:

* Strong post-pandemic recovery
* Higher-than-expected profitability
* Strategic investments such as the e-building project
